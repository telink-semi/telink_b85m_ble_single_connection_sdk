## V3.4.2.4

### Version
* SDK version:telink_b85m_ble_single_connection_sdk_V3.4.2.4
* Driver Version: telink_b85m_driver_sdk V1.7.0

### Hardware
* N/A

### Note
* Copyright update causes all files to change.

* Battery Voltage Check is a very important function for mass production. The user must check battery voltage to prevent abnormal writing or erasing Flash at a low voltage.
	
* Flash protection is a critical function for mass production. 
	- Flash protection is enabled by default in SDK. User must enable this function on their final mass-production application.
	- Users should use "Unlock" command in the Telink BDT tool for Flash access during the development and debugging phase.
	- Flash protection demonstration in SDK is a reference design based on sample code. Considering that the user's final application may be different from the sample code, for example, the user's final firmware size is bigger, or the user has a different OTA design, or the user needs to store more data in some other area of Flash, all these differences imply that Flash protection reference design in SDK can not be directly used on user's mass production application without any change. User should refer to sample code, understand the principles and methods, and then change and implement a more appropriate mechanism according to their application if needed.

* Correct some spelling mistakes
	- For example, change blc_pm_modefy_brx_early_set to blc_pm_modify_brx_early_set.

* Some useless, redundant code was removed
	- For example, delete structure smp_m_param_save_t.


### Bug Fixes
* **software timer**
	- Fixed: Reorder the software timer under the condition that at least one timer exists after deleting one in the function "blt_soft_timer_delete".

* **Application**
	- Fixed: Whitelist sample code process peer Central device special case: use IDA(identity Address) in first pairing phase, but use RPA(Resolvable Private Address) in later reconnect phase.
	- Fixed: Direct ADV may not be connected when the Central(Master) device updates its RPA.
		- In the previous SDK, direct ADV may not be connected automatically when the Central(Master) device refreshes its RPA in "CONNECT_IND" PDU.
		- In the new SDK, if peer IRK is valid, add peer IRK to the resolving list and enable address resolution. direct ADV can be connected even Central(Master) device refreshes RPA.

* **PHY**
	- Fixed: In the BQB RX test, there is a small probability of failure when switching to S2/S8 when the payload is 255Bytes.

* **ATT**
	- Fixed: If the last entry in the ATT table of the server is the Primary Service and there is no characteristic, an incorrect handle will be returned during service discovery.

### BREAKING CHANGES 
* **Boot & Link**	
	- Optimized and simplified the implementation of cstartup.S and boot.link.
		- Add cstartup_825x.S. This file is enough for all B85 projects. The SRAM size is automatically set by judging MCU_STARTUP. Previous 825x cstartup files are deleted as below:
			- cstartup_8251_RET_16K.S/cstartup_8251_RET_32K.S/cstartup_8253_RET_16K.S/cstartup_8253_RET_32K.S/cstartup_8258_RET_16K.S/cstartup_8258_RET_32K.S

		- Add cstartup_827x.S. This file is enough for all B87 projects. The SRAM size is automatically set by judging MCU_STARTUP. Previous 825x cstartup files are deleted as below:
			- cstartup_8271_RET_16K.S/cstartup_8271_RET_32K.S/cstartup_8278_RET_16K.S/cstartup_8278_RET_32K.S/cstartup_8238_RET_16K.S/cstartup_8238_RET_32K.S

		- Add boot.link. This file is enough for all B85/B87 projects. Previous link files are deleted as below:
			- boot_16k_retn_8238.link/boot_32k_retn_8238.link
			- boot_16k_retn_8251_8253_8258.link/boot_32k_retn_8251.link/boot_32k_retn_8253_8258.link
			- boot_16k_retn_8271_8278.link/boot_32k_retn_871.link/boot_32k_retn_8278.link
			
        - Configure "SRAM_SIZE" for different ICs in the project setting.
			- B85
				- Use new macro MCU_STARTUP_8251/MCU_STARTUP_8253/MCU_STARTUP_8258 to configure IC, and MCU_STARTUP_8258 is used by default.
			    - Old macro below is not used anymore: 
				MCU_STARTUP_8258_RET_16K, MCU_STARTUP_8258_RET_32K, 
				MCU_STARTUP_8253_RET_16K, MCU_STARTUP_8253_RET_32K, 
				MCU_STARTUP_8251_RET_16K, MCU_STARTUP_8251_RET_32K				
			- B87
				- Use new macro MCU_STARTUP_8271/MCU_STARTUP_8238/MCU_STARTUP_8278 to configure IC, and MCU_STARTUP_8278 is used by default.
			    - Old macro below is not used anymore: 
				  MCU_STARTUP_8278_RET_16K, MCU_STARTUP_8278_RET_32K, 
				  MCU_STARTUP_8238_RET_16K, MCU_STARTUP_8238_RET_32K, 
				  MCU_STARTUP_8271_RET_16K, MCU_STARTUP_8271_RET_32K

		- Users do not need to be concerned about how to change configurations of different deepsleep retention SRAM size(16K or 32K). It's now processed automatically.
			- "blc_app_setDeepsleepRetentionSramSize" is used to configure deepsleep retention SRAM size automatically.
			- "\_retention_size_" is defined in cstarup.S file, and it is used to automatically calculate the total size of retention SRAM.
			If "_retention_size" exceeds the maximum value(32K bytes), the compiler will report the error "Error: Retention RAM size overflow." for users to notice this.
			- Add user_config.c in vendor/common, and add "__PM_DEEPSLEEP_RETENTION_ENABLE" in this file for retention SRAM size auto calculating and alarming in boot.link.
			"__PM_DEEPSLEEP_RETENTION_ENABLE" equals to "PM_DEEPSLEEP_RETENTION_ENABLE" which is configurated by user in app_config.h.


* **Application**
	- BLE Flash information and Calibration
		- Rename blt_common.h/blt_common.c to ble_flash.h/ble_flash.c.
		- Split function "blc_app_loadCustomizedParameters" into two functions "blc_app_loadCustomizedParameters_normal"	and "blc_app_loadCustomizedParameters_deepRetn".
		The first one is used when the MCU is powered on or wakes up from deepsleep mode. The second one is used when MCU wakes up from deepsleep retention mode.
		- Add API "blc_flash_read_mid_get_vendor_set_capacity" in "blc_readFlashSize_autoConfigCustomFlashSector" to get Flash mid, vendor and capacity information.

* **ATT**
	- Some old ATT APIs are not recommended to use anymore, there are better APIs replaced for each one of them. Hide the old API declaration in the stack. Keep only some external declarations in ble_comp.h in case some users persistently use these APIs.

		- Hide API "bls_att_pushNotifyData", user should use API "blc_gatt_pushHandleValueNotify".
		- Hide API "bls_att_pushIndicateData", user should use API "blc_gatt_pushHandleValueIndicate".
		- Hide API "att_req_find_info", user should use API "blc_gatt_pushFindInformationRequest".
		- Hide API "att_req_find_by_type", user should use API "blc_gatt_pushFindByTypeValueRequest".
		- Hide API "att_req_read_by_type", user should use API "blc_gatt_pushReadByTypeRequest".
		- Hide API "att_req_read", user should use API "blc_gatt_pushReadRequest".
		- Hide API "att_req_read_blob", user should use API "blc_gatt_pushReadBlobRequest".
		- Hide API "att_req_read_by_group_type", user should use API "blc_gatt_pushReadByGroupTypeRequest".
		- Hide API "att_req_write", user should use API "blc_gatt_pushWriteRequest".
		- Hide API "att_req_write_cmd", user should use API "blc_gatt_pushWriteCommand".
	- Remove API "blt_att_resetRxMtuSize".
	- Change "blt_att_setEffectiveMtuSize" to "blc_att_setEffectiveMtuSize".
	- Change "blt_att_resetEffectiveMtuSize" to "blc_att_resetEffectiveMtuSize".

* **L2CAP**

	- Hide API "blc_l2cap_pushData_2_controller". It is an internal API in the stack, and users should not use it.
	When it appeared on the previous SDK, it was used to send a GATT confirm command. Now use the new API "blc_gatt_pushConfirm" to replace it.
	- Hide macro "L2CAP_RX_BUFF_LEN_MAX". This is for internal use in the stack and should not be used by users.
	- Change ATT_RX_MTU_SIZE_MAX to ATT_MTU_MAX_SDK_DFT_BUF.
	- API "blc_l2cap_initMtuBuffer" increases the error return value.

* **SMP**
	- Delete API "blc_smp_setPeerAddrResSupportFlg". It is a special API for local RPA usage on previous SDK with a special library provided to customers if they need it. 
	Now new local RPA feature is included in the general library, so this special API is not needed. Users can refer to feature privacy for new designs.
	- Delete smp_alg.h, change it to algorithm\crypto\crypto_alg.h, and rename the APIs in it.

* **Controller**
	- Hide stack internal APIs, and users should not use them.
		- blc_ll_readMaxAdvDataLength
		- blc_ll_setInitTxDataLength
		- blc_ll_GetBrxNextTick
		- blc_ll_get_macAddrRandom
		- blc_ll_get_macAddrPublic
		- blc_ll_readMaxAdvDataLength
	- Remove API “blc_ll_setAclConnMaxOctetsNumber”.
	- Hide stack internal data structure：
		- ll_data_extension_t
		- rf_pkt_pri_adv_t
		- ll_ext_adv_t
		- Some structures in ble_format.h

* **HCI**
	- Delete the data structure definition "event_connection_update_t", and users can use "hci_le_connectionUpdateCompleteEvt_t" to replace it.
	- Hide API "blc_hci_le_getLocalSupportedFeatures". It is a stack internal API, and users should not use it.

* **OTA** 
	- Hide API "bls_ota_clearNewFwDataArea" and use API "blc_ota_initOtaServer_module" instead.
	- Change "bls_ota_set_fwSize_and_fwBootAddr" to "blc_ota_setFirmwareSizeAndBootAddress"

* **Others** 
	- Fix spelling mistakes.
	- Remove ext_pm.h and ext_rf.h, and the API open to users has been moved to ext_misc.h
	- Remove application\usbstd\usbhw.c, application\usbstd\usbhw.h and application\usbstd\usbhw_i.h, and use usbhw.h and usbhw.c in the driver instead.
	- Remove the ADC calibration data structure "adc_vref_ctr_t" in adc.h/adc.c. The original ADC calibration data at the application layer is stored in the adc_gpio_calib_vref, adc_gpio_calib_vref_offset and adc_vbat_calib_vref. Refer to telink_b85m_driver_sdk_Release_Note.

### Features
* **Application**
	- Add Flash Protection module and sample 
		- Add flash_prot.h/flash_prot.c in vendor/common folder as a common module for all applications.
		- Add Flash protection sample code in project B85m_ble_sample/B85m_ble_remote/B85m_ble_module/B85m_master_kma_dongle. User can refer to the sample code and make sure the Flash protection function	must be enabled on their own application.
		- "app_flash_protection_operation" is a common entrance for all Flash operations (Flash write and erase), Flash locking and unlocking are processed in this function.
		- "blc_appRegisterStackFlashOperationCallback" and "flash_prot_op_cb" are used to process some stack internal Flash operation callback which may need Flash locking and unlocking.
		- The Telink OTA and SMP module already add callbacks related to blc_flashProt to inform the application layer that they need to write/erase Flash. Then, the application layer processes Flash lock and unlock.
		- If users do not use Telink OTAs, they need to refer to this design to add similar callback functions in their own OTA code for upper-layer use.
		- Now only firmware is protected in the sample code. System data and user data are not protected now.
		- IRQ disabling time too long in driver API "flash_write_status", BLE system interrupt is delayed, causing RX data error. 
		Driver API "flash_write_status" be replaced by "flash_write_status" in flash_prot.c to solve this issue by calling LinkLayer API "blc_ll_write_flash_status".

	- Add tlkapi_debug module to print logs
		- Add tlkapi_debug.h/tlkapi_debug.c in vendor/common folder as a common module for all applications.
		- Add debug.h in stack/ble/debug. Add APIS "blc_debug_enableStackLog", "blc_debug_addStackLog", "blc_debug_removeStackLog" to control the print stack log.
		- Use GPIO simulating UART TX sequence to output data information to PC UART tool, same function with "printf" function in old SDK.
		- API "tlkapi_printf" and "tlkapi_send_string_data" are recommended for usage, with some macro in app_config.h to control log enabling such as "APP_LOG_EN".
		- Only 1M baud rate can be used. When the system clock is 16M/24M, the assembly is used to control the UART TX timing. When the system clock is 32M/48M, the system_timer is used to control the UART TX timing. IRQ disabling and restoring are used in function "uart_putc" to guarantee UART TX byte data integrity is not broken by IRQ. 
		If the baud rate is too low, IRQ disabling time too long, BLE system interrupt and user interrupt will be affected which may lead to critical error.

	- Add stack initialization error check for all applications.
		- Add API "blc_contr_checkControllerInitialization" to check if any controller initialization fails.
		- Add API "blc_host_checkHostInitialization" to check if any host initialization fails.	
		- Add enumeration definition "init_err_t" in ble_common.h to distinguish error types.
		- Users should add some UI alarm action to know whether an initialization error happens, and then check the reason according to the definition of enumeration "init_err_t".

### Hardware
* N/A

### Note
* Copyright更新，引起所有文件发生变化。

* 电池电压检测是量产的重要功能。
	- 用户必须检查电池电压，以防止在低电压下Flash写入或擦除异常。
	
* Flash保护是量产的必要功能。
	- SDK中默认开启Flash保护。用户必须在最终的量产应用中启用此功能。
	- 在开发和调试阶段，用户可以使用Telink BDT工具中的“Unlock”命令进行Flash解锁。
	- SDK中的Flash保护是基于示例代码的参考设计。考虑到用户的最终应用可能与示例代码不同，如用户的最终固件尺寸更大，或者用户有不同的OTA设计，或者用户需要在Flash的其他区域存储更多的数据，这些差异都意味着SDK中的Flash保护参考设计不可能在不做任何更改的情况下直接用于用户的量产应用。用户应参考示例代码，了解原理和方法，然后根据自己的应用更改和实现更适合的机制。

* 纠正一些拼写错误
	- 如修改blc_pm_modefy_brx_early_set为blc_pm_modify_brx_early_set。

* 删除了一些无用的、冗余的代码
	- 如删除结构体“smp_m_param_save_t”。


### Bug Fixes
* **Software Timer**
	- 修复：调用API "blt_soft_timer_delete"删除一个software timer任务后，在至少存在一个software timer任务的情况下，才对software timer任务重新排序。

* **Application**
	- 修复：白名单示例代码处理对端Central设备特殊情况:在第一个配对阶段使用IDA(Identity Address)，但在后面的重新连接阶段使用RPA(Resolvable Private Address)。

	- 修复：在旧版SDK中，当Central(Master)设备使用RPA地址，且更新CONNECT_IND PDU中的RPA时，直连广播可能不会自动连接。新版SDK中，如果对端IRK有效，将对端IRK添加到解析列表中并启用地址解析后，即使Central(Master)设备刷新RPA，也可以连接直连广播。

* **PHY**
	- 修复：在BQB RX测试中，payload为255Bytes，切换到S2/S8时，会小概率出现失败。

* **ATT**
	- 修复：当server端ATT表最后一项为Primary Service并且无characteristic，会导致服务发现过程中返回错误的handle。

### Features
* **Application**
	- 新增Flash Protection模块和示例
		- 在vendor/common文件夹中添加flash_prot.h/flash_prot.c作为所有应用程序的通用模块。
		- 在B85m_ble_sample/B85m_ble_remote/B85m_ble_module/B85m_master_kma_dongle中增加Flash保护示例代码，用户可以参考示例代码，并必须确保Flash保护功能在应用程序上启用。
		- “app_flash_protection_operation”是所有Flash操作(Flash写、擦除)的通用入口，Flash加锁和解锁都在这个函数中进行。
		- “blc_appRegisterStackFlashOperationCallback”和“flash_prot_op_cb”用于处理一些协议栈内部Flash操作的回调，这些回调可能需要Flash加锁和解锁。
			- 协议栈OTA模块已经正确增加blc_flashProt相关回调，告知应用层SMP需要write/erase Flash的操作。应用层需要对应处理Flash lock/unlock。
			- 如果客户不使用Telink OTA，需参考此设计在OTA代码中添加类似的回调函数供上层使用。
		- 现在只有固件在示例代码中受到保护，系统数据和用户数据现在不受保护。
		- 驱动API “flash_write_status”中中断禁用时间过长，BLE系统中断会延迟，导致接收数据错误。将驱动API “flash_write_status”替换为flash_prot.c中的“flash_write_status”，通过调用LinkLayer API “blc_ll_write_flash_status”来解决此问题。

	- 新增tlkapi_debug模块打印日志

		- 在stack/ble/debug文件夹中新增debug.h，新增API“blc_debug_enableStackLog”，“blc_debug_addStackLog”，blc_debug_removeStackLog”控制协议栈log打印。
		- 使用GPIO模拟UART TX时序将打印信息输出，功能与旧版SDK中的“printf”功能相同。
		- 建议使用API "tlkapi_printf"和"tlkapi_send_string_data"，并在app_config.h中使用一些宏来控制日志启用，例如"APP_LOG_EN"。
		- 只支持1M波特率，系统时钟为16M/24M时通过汇编指令控制UART TX时序，系统时钟为32M/48M时通过system_timer控制UART TX时序。IRQ禁用和恢复在函数“uart_put”中使用，以保证UART TX字节数据的完整性不被IRQ破坏。如果波特率过低，IRQ禁用时间过长，会影响BLE系统中断或者用户中断，可能导致严重错误。

	- 新增协议栈初始化错误检查
		- 新增API “blc_contr_checkControllerInitialization”检查是否有Controller初始化失败。
		- 新增API "blc_host_checkHostInitialization"检查是否有Host初始化失败。
